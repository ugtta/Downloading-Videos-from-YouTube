# Mohamed-Makki-Project-2-OMAC-Downloading-Videos-from-YouTube
program for downloading video from YouTube Website

important note: 
to make this program work in any computer, you should do one of the following steps:
first: change the folder location specified in the last code (destination path) 'C:\\Users\mak\Downloads'
by changing (mak) in this path to the (user_name) as per your computer.
second: or simply remove this path from the code (use empty parenthesis) in the last code as following:

    change the code to . . . . .    stream.download()
    instead of . . . . . . . . .    stream.download('C:\\Users\mak\Downloads')

but in this case the video file will be downloaded to the default folder:
     
     C:\\Users\user_name
     
     user_name is the user of the computer (in my case "mak"). 
     and in this case you have to search for the downloaded video file in this folder

This project allows us to download any video from YouTube site,
first will prompt us to enter the link of the required video on the YouTube (full web address)
then the code will allow us to download the video with all necessary corresponding information such as:
Title of the video, Time-Length (Duration), Counts of Views, Brief Description and Ratings.
